      Suggested use is to run Google Chrome in kiosk mode on a small tablet,
      then click on one of the slideshows to launch the slideshow player. The slideshow elements will loop infinitely without displaying the browser. You can then mount the iPad / tablet on the wall if desired. 
    </p>

      To exit Kiosk mode on iPad, triple-click the iPad home button, enter your passcode and tap End in the top left.
